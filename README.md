# Readme Pull Requests
ReadmePullRequests is designed to automate the process of updating the README.md file in a GitHub repository whenever a pull request (PR) is created.

In addition to automating the update of the README.md file, the workflow also offers advanced customization options:

- Bold Selected Repositories: You can choose to highlight specific repositories by making them bold in the README.md file. This allows you to emphasize certain repositories among the list that the workflow generates.

- Hide Specific Repositories: The workflow provides an option to exclude certain repositories from appearing in the README.md file. This is useful if you want to keep the focus on only the most relevant repositories.

- Direct Links to Pull Requests: You have the option to include direct links to specific pull requests within the README.md. This feature allows users to quickly access the pull requests associated with the changes, providing more context or facilitating easier navigation.

These features make the workflow highly flexible, allowing you to tailor the content of your README.md file to suit your project's needs while maintaining up-to-date documentation.
